# Algorithm 1 - Optimal Stopping
## The Problem
*   Gyms usually offer discounts or deals on new memerships in order to incentivize people to join after making their New Year's resolutions, but when is the best time to end those deals, since people tend to stop going to the gym and either don't take advantage of or cancel their memberships? At what point will the gym start losing money on their members instead of making money from them by offering these deals? 
    *   When should the gym end deals on memberships given: *When people stop going to the gym after starting their New Year's Resolutions?*
## The Data
*   This data is synthesized from survey information found online about how long people follow through on their New Year's Resolutions

## The Output
*   The graph produced from this year-long distribution shows, at its peak, the best day for a gym to end its deal on memberships after the New Year in order to make the most possible money.

## NOTE ABOUT THE PROGRAM
*   The program takes a few moments to run, to re-view the menu after selecting Option 1 the user needs to hit the exit button on the graph that appears.
