# CS5060 Final Project (Implementation)

## Algorithm 1 - Optimal Stopping
*   TODO : [FILL IN WHEN COMPLETING]

## Algorithm 2 - Bayes Theorem
*   The Theorem
    *   `P(A|B) = P(A AND B) / P(B)`
    *   Where:
        *   `P(A|B)` is the conditional probability of `A` given `B`
        *   `P(B|A)` is the conditional probability of `B` given `A`
        *   `P(A)` is the prior probability of `A`
        *   `P(B)` is the prior probability of `B`
*   The problem the algorithm will solve:
    *   What is the probability of gym attendance (A) given
        *   The time of day & the day of the week (what the capacity is at) (B)
    *   Assume the following
        *   if the gym is more than 50% busy then a gym goer will not go to the gym
*   This data can be easily pulled from google map's data
    *   Collecting the data on local gyms in the area and using it in Bayes Theorem would satisfy the requirements of this algorithm and problem in this project.

## Algorithm 3 - Scheduling
*  The problem:
    *   Personal Training: Use a scheduling algorithm to optimize personal training schedules for both trainers and clients. The algorithm can take into account the availability of the trainer and the preferences of the client, as well as their fitness goals and current fitness level.
