# CS5060 Final Project (Implementation)

## Algorithm 1 - Optimal Stopping
*   TODO : [FILL IN WHEN COMPLETING]

## Algorithm 2 - Bayes Theorem
*   The Theorem
    *   `P(A|B) = P(A AND B) / P(B)`
    *   Where:
        *   `P(A|B)` is the conditional probability of `A` given `B`
        *   `P(B|A)` is the conditional probability of `B` given `A`
        *   `P(A)` is the prior probability of `A`
        *   `P(B)` is the prior probability of `B`
*   The problem the algorithm will solve:
    *   What is the probability of gym attendance (A) given
        *   The time of day & the day of the week (what the capacity is at) (B)
    *   Assume the following
        *   if the gym is more than 50% busy then a gym goer will not go to the gym
*   This data can be easily pulled from google map's data
    *   Collecting the data on local gyms in the area and using it in Bayes Theorem would satisfy the requirements of this algorithm and problem in this project.

## Algorithm 3 - Scheduling
