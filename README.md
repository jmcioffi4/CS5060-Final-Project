# CS5060 Final Project - User's Manual

# Using the program
*   run the program (found in the `src/` directory) by typing
    ```
    [src] % python3 main.py
    ```
*   When the program is run, the UI will look like this:
    ```
    ---------------------------
    **MENU**

    1 = Optimal Stopping
    2 = Bayes Theorem
    3 = Scheduling
    CTRL+C` = Exit 

    >> 
    ```
    *   The `>>` indicates where your cursor is and what you're typing as your input.
    *   This program will take any input you throw at it. The only valid options are the ones listed above in the `Menu`.
*   To exit the program, just use `CTRL+C` on your keyboard.
